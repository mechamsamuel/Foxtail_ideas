# Landing Page Best Practices

### Banner Image

##### Image/Video

##### Tagline
- Title needs to pop and stand out (differentiate important words by bolding and changing colors) 
- Include catchy tagline under title if you see appropriate 
- Try to use a question
- Use pain points in title

##### CTA
For all CTA colors, if the client does not already have a bright CTA color on their site you can use https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ to help find one. I like to use the "Complementary" "Color Rule". You can use one of your client's site color as one of the colors in the color wheel, then use a bright complementary color from the Adobe Color Wheel as your CTA. 

###### Form 
- Find out what information client would like to receive from form
- We reccomend First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number
- Make submit button a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold. 
- Make sure to style the thank you pop up, or redirect to another thank you page.
- Make sure to make certain fields required. 

###### Phone Number
- Format (xxx) xxx-xxxx for viewable phone number (*Note: don't confuse with format of link for phone number)
- Make sure phone number is clickable : See https://github.com/mechamsamuel/Foxtail_ideas/blob/master/unbouncetricks.md
- Make phone a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold. 
- Tell people what you want them to do. Ex. Call Now! (541) 680 - 5840

###### Button
- a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold.

##### Make sure to have value props for whatever the page is offering 

- Make them clear/easy to find 

- Put most important values first 

- Have them more towards the top of the page 

##### Make sure to include social proofs if available. This includes logos of companies that use the client’s products or logos of places they’ve been featured in (ex: Forbes, NY Times, etc.) 

##### Include testimonials when possible. Search client’s site for them or if needed, have AM reach out for some. 

##### Include the copyrite at the bottom with the correct year 

##### Use colors similar to clients 

##### Make sure to create the mobile version of landing page 

##### Integrate with marketing automation when necessary 

#### Setup page to send client new leads. Get email address from AM 
##### Make sure to insert the pixels from the PPC team into the landing pages as well. 
##### Title should address the problem the target audience faces 

Put landing page into the links section of Teamwork when complete as well. 

Once complete, please put into the "Review & Approve Landing Page for Social Promotion Campaigns" task for the client to review.
