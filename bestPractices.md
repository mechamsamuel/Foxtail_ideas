# Landing Page Best Practices

### Banner Image

##### Image/Video

##### Tagline
- Title needs to pop and stand out (differentiate important words by bolding and changing colors) 
- Include catchy tagline under title if you see appropriate 
- Try to use a question
- Use pain points in title

##### CTA
For all CTA colors, if the client does not already have a bright CTA color on their site you can use https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ to help find one. I like to use the "Complementary" "Color Rule". You can use one of your client's site color as one of the colors in the color wheel, then use a bright complementary color from the Adobe Color Wheel as your CTA. 

###### Form 
- Find out what information client would like to receive from form
- We reccomend First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number
- Make submit button a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold. 
- Make sure to style the thank you pop up, or redirect to another thank you page.
- Make sure to make certain fields required. 

###### Phone Number
- Format (xxx) xxx-xxxx for viewable phone number (*Note: don't confuse with format of link for phone number)
- Make sure phone number is clickable : See https://github.com/mechamsamuel/Foxtail_ideas/blob/master/unbouncetricks.md
- Make phone a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold. 
- Tell people what you want them to do. Ex. Call Now! (541) 555 - 5555

###### Button
- a bright color that is easily visible and different from any other color used above the fold.
- Have it easily seen : ways to do this - 
  - Aline it with how they will read your Heading and Sub Heading 
  - Have your image point to the CTA. ex: have the person in your image pointing or looking at your CTA
  - Actually create an arrow that points at your CTA. 
 
##### Make sure to have value props for whatever the page is offering 

- Make them clear/easy to find 

- Put most important values first 

- Have them more towards the top of the page 

##### Make sure to include social proofs if available. This includes logos of companies that use the client’s products or logos of places they’ve been featured in (ex: Forbes, NY Times, etc.) 

##### Include testimonials when possible. Search client’s site for them or if needed, have AM reach out for some. 

##### Include the copyrite at the bottom with the correct year 

##### Use colors similar to clients

- With the banner image you can change the banner image on a phone and keep it the same on dektop if it does not look good on the phone. 

##### Integrate with marketing automation when necessary 

#### Setup page to send client new leads. Get email address from AM 
##### Make sure to insert the pixels from the PPC team into the landing pages as well. 
##### Title should address the problem the target audience faces 

Put landing page into the links section of Teamwork when complete as well.
